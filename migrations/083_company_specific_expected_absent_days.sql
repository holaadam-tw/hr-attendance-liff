-- ============================================================
-- 083: Company-specific expected/absent days
--
-- Rule:
-- - Benmi keeps schedule-based payroll mode:
--   expected_days and absent_days stay NULL.
-- - Other companies, including Da Zheng, use general/fixed-shift mode:
--   expected_days and absent_days are calculated automatically.
--
-- This updates the monthly attendance RPC only. It does not change tables.
